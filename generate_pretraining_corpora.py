# TODO: Generate two corpora:
    # (1) S2ORC Abstracts on Obamacare
    # (2) Whatever texts are discarded in the LHIC
        # Use a zero-shot classification model to identify paragraphs in the discarded texts that are related to given topics, and use them to create paragraph pairings
            # Paragraphs with similar topics will be used to make pairs of similar paragraphs, paragraphs with different topics will be used to make pairs of different topics
