"""
This program is designed to extract text from directories of PDFs, converting all pages to images, enhancing image contrast, 
and performing OCR on images. This is to be used for non-digital-native PDFs or PDFs that have high error when using other 
extraction tools (such as extract_text_from_corpus.py). This program loops over the pages of each file in the directory, 
converts each page to an image, and performs optical character recognition (OCR) to extract the text.
