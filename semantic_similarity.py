    # (1) 20 most similar paragraphs from the LHIC
    # (2) 2-3 most similar paragraphs from each of the 3 branches in the LHIC
    # (3) Average of those 20 most similar sentence simiarlities - Witness Impact Metric (WIM)
    # (4) Average of the 2-3 most similar paragraphs from each of the 3 branches - Which branch each witness impacts most
        # This information will allow us to see the differences of impact by occupation (agency officials are expected to be most similar to executive)
    # (4) Date of the witness testimony
        # This will allow us to trach WIM development over time
